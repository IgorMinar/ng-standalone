<h1>Angular Standalone Component Demo</h1>

<p>This is a simple demo project, that shows what a standalone <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Directive</code>, and
  <code>@Pipe</code> in Angular could look like in the future.
</p>

<p>The mental model of standalone Components, Directives, and Pipes is simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the class of each component, directive, and pipe (from now on just entities) is shadowed by a "virtual" NgModule
    that is automatically created by the system.</li>
  <li>this NgModule declares only the single entity that it shadows</li>
  <li>any existing NgModule or API that accepts NgModules can import the standalone entity directly</li>
  <li>a standalone entity can import any other standalone entity, or an existing NgModule</li>
</ul>

<p>This design has enables strong introp and encapsulation guarantees making it easy to mix and match standalone
  entitities with code of existing applications and libraries in the Angular ecosystem.</p>

<p>Specifically, this design has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>encapsulation and isolation:
    <ul>
      <li>a standalone entity is available to be used in a template of a non-standalone component only if it is imported
        into the NgModule of the non-standalone component</li>
      <li>a standalone entity can use only other entities that were defined in its <code>imports</code></li>
    </ul>
  <li>error resiliency:
    <ul>
      <li>importing a non-standalone entity directly anywhere in the system is an error</li>
      <li>declaring a standalone entity in an NgModule is an error</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>discovery and readability:<ul>
      <li>to make it clear to both the code reader, as well as the compiler/IDE/linter which entity is standalone, we
        use syntatic
        element in the form of <code>standalone</code> property within the decorator metadata</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ability to evolve the API in the future
    <ul>
      <li>if the "standalone" style is accepted by the community, the <code>standalone</code> property could
        default to <code>true</code> and become optional</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Demo implementation notes: The demo is built by wrapping an existing <code>@Component</code>,
  <code>@Directive</code>, and <code>@Pipe</code> decorators and generating
  a hidden (virtual)
  NgModule. The
  application, including the standalone entities, is then compiled using the JIT compiler.

Demonstrate how to do:
<ul>
  <li>(WIP) dynamic component composition with standalone components</li>
  <li>(WIP) routing with standable components</li>
  <li><code>@angular/elements</code> integration</li>
