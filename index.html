<h1>RFC: standalone components, directives and pipes - demo</h1>

<p>
  This is a simple demo project showing what a standalone
  <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Directive</code>, and <code>@Pipe</code> in
  Angular could look like in the future. This demo is based on the design
  proposed in the
  <a href="https://hackmd.io/UtrGeYMlSE6mOzOI3hM16Q?view" target="_blank"
    >RFC: standalone components, directives and pipes - making Angularâ€™s
    NgModules optional</a
  >
</p>

<p>
  Demo implementation notes: The demo is built by wrapping an existing
  <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Directive</code>, and
  <code>@Pipe</code> decorators and generating a hidden (virtual) NgModule. The
  application, including the standalone entities, is then compiled using the JIT
  compiler. This is <i>not</i> the intended implementation of the design
  described in the RFC - it is a quick prototype enabling early experiments with
  the new APIs.
