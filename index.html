<h1>Angular Standalone Component Demo</h1>

<p>This is a simple demo project, that shows what a standalone <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Directive</code>, and
  <code>@Pipe</code> in Angular could look
  like in the future.
</p>

<p>The demo is built by wrapping an existing <code>@Component</code> decorator and generating a hidden (virtual)
  NgModule. The
  application, including the standalone component, is then compiled using the JIT compiler.</p>
