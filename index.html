<h1>Angular Standalone Component Demo</h1>

<p>This is a simple demo project, that shows what a standalone <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Directive</code>, and
  <code>@Pipe</code> in Angular could look like in the future.
</p>

<p>The mental model of standalone Components, Directives, and Pipes is simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each component, directive, and pipe class is shadowed by a "virtual" NgModule that is automatically created by the system.</li>
  <li>this NgModule declares only the single entity that it shadows</li>
  <li>any existing NgModule or API that accepts NgModules can import the standalone entity directly</li>
  <li>a standalone entity can import any other standalone entity, or an existing NgModule</li>
  <li>importing a non-standalone entity directly anywhere in the system is an error</li>
  <li>declaring a standalone entity in an NgModule is an error</li>
  <li>to make it clear to both the code reader, as well as the compiler which entity is standalone, we use syntatic element in the form of <code>standalone</code> property within the decorator metadata</li>
  <li>in the future, if the "standalone" style is accepted by the community, the <code>standalone</code> property could default to <code>true</code> and become optional</li>
</ul>

<p>Demo implementation notes: The demo is built by wrapping an existing <code>@Component</code> decorator and generating a hidden (virtual)
  NgModule. The
  application, including the standalone component, is then compiled using the JIT compiler.</p>

<h2> Next steps</h2>

Demonstrate how to do:
<ul>
  <li>create and use standalone Directives</li>
  <li>create and use standalone Pipes</li>
  <li>dynamic component composition with standalone components</li>
  <li>bootstrap an app using just a standalone component</li>
  <li>routing with standable components</li>
  <li>experiment with supporting <code>exports</code> to support use cases of collaborating directives</li>
  <li><code>@angular/elements</code> integration</li>
</ul>
